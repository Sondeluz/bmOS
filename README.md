# bmOS

bmOS, reloaded.

TODO:
  - Get rid of the weird client-server architecture, cram everyting into a Pi Zero or a clone using https://github.com/tazz4843/whisper-rs
  - Rewrite everyting in cleaner Rust code
  - (Maybe) switch from SDL2 to wgpu
  - Some kind of inference of the received speech to text, instead of using simple intent matches
  - ???
